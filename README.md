Using Bayesian Analysis (Monte Carlo simulation) to understand the difference between tumor genesis in types of mice

A cancer lab is estimating the rate of tumorgenesis in two types of mice. Type A mice have been well stuidied , and information from other labs indicates that type A mice have tumor counts that are approximately poisson distributed with a mean of 12, and theta a has a gamma distribution as gamma(120,12). Type B mice tumor counts are unknown distribution.
